    "Travel salesman is the most known problem of combinatorial optimization, i.e. there's no continuous function to optimize, but instead a discrete sequence of elements to rearrange in the best way to obtain a minimum cost: in our case, we have a sequence of cities to visit, and the cost function is nothing but the total covered distance among the cities. Genetic algorithm is a stochastic method which aims to provide a solution by inducing random permutations in our city sequences. Let's take an example: we want to visit five cities, labeled by five numbers respectively, in the following order:"

Labelling each city with a number from $0$ to $29$, we'll save these coords in a vector; using this coord vector, we may know the distance among all pair of cities. Thereafter, we're going to define a cost function $L$ able to evaluate the sum of all distances in a string of cities, keeping fixed all the cities coordinates (but not their sequence).

In our case, we have to deal with 30 cities, thus $C=30$, and $P$ may be fixed as $100$ (so we'll have 100 strings to be remixed by our genetic operators); $S[i][j]$ points at the $j$-th gene in the $i$-th chromosome. The lenght function $L$ we've defined above takes a string as input and returns all distances sum.
