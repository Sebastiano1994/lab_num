    "In this exercise our task is to simulate a random 3D walk, both in a discrete and a continuous version, then sample $\\sqrt{\\left<R_i^2\\right>}$ for each $i$-th step ($R_i^2$ being the modulus $x_i^2+y_i^2+z_i^2$). What we have to do is thus generate many trajectories in order to average over each $R_i$: this makes us describe $R_i$ more just like $R_{ij}$, where $i$ means the actual step, $j$ the peculiar trajectory we're considering. We may want to simulate 100 steps for a random walk, what's matter is to have a huge number of trajectories for our 100 averages (one average for each step); we've generated something like $10^4$ trajectories, making each of them evolve for 100 steps and start from the origin, which means $x_{0j}=y_{0j}=z_{0j}=0 \\; \\forall j$ (starting position, index $0$, is null for all $j$ trajectories). To do this, let's allocate three double arrays, i.e. three matrices, each of them containing in memory the $i$-th cartesian position for the $j$-th trajectory; we have accomplished this in our file main.cpp, from here on, in this file, it follows all the algorithm we're going to describe. Our arrays will be initialized as"
