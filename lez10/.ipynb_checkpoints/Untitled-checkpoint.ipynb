    "In the previous exercise, we generated a vaste population of 100 individuals, acting randomly over all chromosomes whose cost function wasn't the minimum one. By introducing annealing techniques, we're going to use a Metropolis algorithm to accept or discard specific mutations on each chromosome; thus, we need to define a \"probability\" over this population. Essentially, we can borrow from Boltzmann distribution an idea of what we need:"

    "$S_0$, $S_1$ standing for the same sequence before and after recombining. The higher the value of $\\beta$, the higher the probability to accept ($\\Delta L>0$) or discard ($\\Delta L<0$) the mutation we induced. Hence, what we're going to do is define a high temperature (i.e. a low value of $\\beta$): while acting on the whole population via a combination of genetic operators and Metropolis acceptance, we have to lowering gradually the temperature (raising $\\beta$): at the end, probability of accepting even the smallest cost increase $\\Delta L>0$ will be null. Let's say, we're gonna increasing $\\beta$ by 0.1 units each timestep (beta+=0.1). Warning: annealing involves we're introducing potential walls too, with many risks to fall in local minima (instead of a global one); it could be useful to start from very different sequences, when allocating initial chromosomes."

As a matter of fact, you may notice that this time we've set a number of step $M=10^4$, which is far smaller (one magnitude) than $10^5$, which was required for equilibration by vanilla genetic algorithms."
