As we'll observe no phase transition but the trivial one, in order to measure magnetization we will set $h=0.02$, while for measuring over all the other observables we'll switch off the external field ($h=0$); $h$ value may be set in file input.dat at line 4."

What we've done is: we choose a random spin between 1 and 50, we evaluate the cost of flipping, then Metropolis algorithm determines to flip or not to flip the chosen spin. In order to equilibrate the system before measuring, we've decided to move the system for a while without measuring any quantity (let's say, if a maximum of step is given, we add another 1/3, nearly, of these moves in order to equilibrate). Furthermore, before beginning with simulation, the user may choose to generate a random new configuration or to start from a saved one (from text file config.final) at the end of a previous simulation: this may be useful when we want to reach equilibrium at low $T$, or when we want to raise, simulation after simulation, our temperature by a little increase (for instance, after a simulation at $T=0.3$, we want to evolve the same system at $T=0.4$). This option can be switched at line 8 of file input.dat: if is set to $0$, it means the system will generate a new random configuration to equilibrate, otherwise, for any other number, the executable will start from a previous configuration saved in config.final."

After that, we've nothing but to repeat the same procedure for all temperature we're interested in. At the end, we've plotted the following graphs (in function of temperature):"
